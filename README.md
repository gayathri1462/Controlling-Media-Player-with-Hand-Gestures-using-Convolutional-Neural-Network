The main aim of the system is to use the most natural form i.e., hand gestures to interact with the computer system. These gestures would be implemented such that they are easy to perform, fast, efficient and ensuring an immediate response. 

The goal of this project is to create a web application which uses your device's camera to give you touch-free  and remote-free control over your any  media player application (without any special hardware). It increases your  productivity and makes your life easier and comfortable by letting you control your device from a distance.
